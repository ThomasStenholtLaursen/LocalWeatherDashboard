# Setup

### **Clone the GitHub project to desired local folder with:**

```
git clone https://github.com/ThomasStenholtLaursen/LocalWeatherDashboard
```

### **Navigate to root folder and run locally with:**

## Comments

I wanted to make a well-structured and good looking dashboard to show the weather conditions for a specific location. The tech stack consits of tech I've previously worked with and some that's new to me. I've attempted to make it a good user experience by laying out the data nicely in a responsive grid so it should work on all devices. I've used React Query from TanStack which I use to fetch via the NSwag-autogenerated client which seems to work well. With the generated code I'm provided with the interfaces and functions for each object and endpoint that the API provides which helps when working with especially TypeScript. I looked at the data from the `complete`-endpoint and used what I found relevant.
You try endpoint I used at

```
https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/complete?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}
```

I took some sorting of the data and there was some complications with the time element regarding UTC timezones etc, however I didnt spend too much effort on that. To display the date and time I made date formatters.

The application is attempted to be structured in a way to make it readable and easy provide a overview. Especially for the dashboard itself the code has been split into different components provide a better overview.
